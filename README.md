# Win10iot-hello-world
‘Hello, world!’  In this sample, we will create and deploy the proverbial 1st app, “Hello, world!” to any device running Windows 10 IoT Core.

#Create a new C# project
All of the sample code is available to download, but as an exercise, this tutorial will take you through the complete steps to create this app from scratch. You need to make sure you have installed the Windows 10 IoT Core Project Templates from here: https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/55b357e1-a533-43ad-82a5-a88ac4b01dec

NOTE: This app will display on the devices primary display. You can use the Windows IoT Remote Client app if you do not have a screen connected to your device.
